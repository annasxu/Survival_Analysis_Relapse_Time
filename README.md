# Survival_Analysis_Relapse_Time
The objective of this study is to identify what factors, or combination of factors, contributed to the relapse time of alcoholics. We are also interested in which of the two treatments (cognitive-behavioral or social) is superior in elongating relapse time compared to the other. We reviewed a total of 576 alcoholic patients and used a Cox PH model to analyze a range of genetic and environmental factors.   We concluded that family support, prior number of alcohol treatments, type of treatment,  age, and the interaction between age and prior number of treatments were significant factors that influenced relapse time. Specifically, stronger family support, more prior treatments, younger ages were associated with a higher hazard of relapse to alcoholism. We also found the treatment emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy improved relapse time more than social therapy.
